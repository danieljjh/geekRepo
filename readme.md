## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (Markdown documents) to get you started.

- [inbox](./inbox.md) - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later
- [getting-started](./getting-started.md) - learn how to use your Foam workspace
- [todo](./todo.md) - a place to keep track of things to do

In the `docs` directory you can find everything you need to learn the basics of Foam.

## Submitting Issues
